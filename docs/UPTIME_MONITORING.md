# Uptime Monitoring Setup Guide

## Purpose

Prevent Render.com's free tier from spinning down your app after 15 minutes of inactivity. By pinging your health endpoint every 10 minutes, you can keep your app warm 24/7 and eliminate cold starts.

## Option 3: Koyeb (Alternative)

**Free Tier Benefits:**
- âœ… 2 web services
- âœ… No sleep/cold starts
- âœ… Better than Render for always-on apps

If you find Render's cold starts still annoying even with monitoring, consider migrating to Koyeb's free tier which doesn't spin down.

## Verification Checklist

After setting up monitoring, verify it's working:

- [ ] Monitor shows "Up" status
- [ ] No cold start delay when accessing the app
- [ ] Render logs show regular `/api/health` requests every 10 minutes
- [ ] App responds instantly at any time of day
- [ ] Email alerts configured for downtime (optional)

---

## Cost Savings

**Without Monitoring:**
- First request after 15+ min: 30-60 second cold start
- Users frustrated with slow initial load
- Poor user experience

**With Monitoring:**
- âœ… Instant response 24/7
- âœ… Professional experience
- âœ… **Still 100% free** (using free monitoring services)
- âœ… Extends free tier usability indefinitely

---

## Troubleshooting

### Monitor Shows "Down"
- Check if your Render app is deployed and running
- Verify the URL is correct (include `/api/health`)
- Check Render logs for errors
- Ensure health endpoint returns HTTP 200

### Still Getting Cold Starts
- Reduce monitoring interval to 5 minutes (UptimeRobot minimum)
- Verify monitor is actually running (check execution history)
- Check if Render has any service interruptions

### Too Many Requests in Logs
- 10-minute intervals = 144 requests/day
- This is minimal and well within Render's free tier limits
- Don't reduce interval further unless necessary

---

## Advanced: Multiple Monitors

For production reliability, set up monitors on multiple services:

1. **UptimeRobot:** Primary health checks (every 10 min)
2. **Cron-Job.org:** Backup health checks (every 15 min)
3. **Pingdom (Free tier):** Status page monitoring

This provides redundancy if one monitoring service goes down.

## Next Steps

After setting up uptime monitoring:
1. âœ… Verify no more cold starts
2. Implement image compression (next priority)
3. Add pagination to reduce bandwidth
4. Monitor Supabase usage weekly

Your app should now stay warm 24/7 on Render's free tier! ðŸš€
