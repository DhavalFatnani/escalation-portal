# Ticket Flow Verification

## Current Workflow Implementation

### Flow 1: OPS Member Creates Ticket → Growth Team Processes

**Step 1: OPS Member Creates Ticket**
- Status: `open`
- `created_by`: OPS member ID
- `assigned_to`: `NULL` (pending assignment)
- **Visible to**: Growth Manager (via `getIncomingTickets` - shows tickets where creator role = 'ops')

**Step 2: Growth Manager Assigns to Growth Member**
- Status: `open`
- `assigned_to`: Growth member ID
- **Visible to**: 
  - Growth Manager (via `getIncomingTickets` - still shows it)
  - Growth Member (via `assigned_to` filter)

**Step 3: Growth Member Resolves (Processes)**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/resolve`
- Status changes: `open` → `processed`
- `current_assignee`: Growth member ID
- `primary_resolution_remarks`: Set
- **Visible to**: 
  - OPS Manager (should see in Outgoing? Or Incoming processed?)
  - OPS Member who created it (their escalation)

**Step 4: OPS Team Reviews & Accepts**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/accept` (needs to be created?)
- Status: `processed` → `resolved`
- `resolved_at`: timestamp
- **Visible to**: Both teams for historical reference

### Flow 2: Growth Member Creates Ticket → OPS Team Processes

**Step 1: Growth Member Creates Ticket**
- Status: `open`
- `created_by`: Growth member ID
- `assigned_to`: `NULL`
- **Visible to**: OPS Manager (via `getIncomingTickets` - shows tickets where creator role = 'growth')

**Step 2: OPS Manager Assigns to OPS Member**
- Status: `open`
- `assigned_to`: OPS member ID
- **Visible to**: 
  - OPS Manager (via `getIncomingTickets`)
  - OPS Member (via `assigned_to` filter)

**Step 3: OPS Member Resolves (Processes)**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/resolve`
- Status: `open` → `processed`
- `current_assignee`: OPS member ID
- **Visible to**: 
  - Growth Manager (should see for review)
  - Growth Member who created it (their escalation)

**Step 4: Growth Team Reviews & Accepts**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/accept`
- Status: `processed` → `resolved`

## Current Issues Identified

### ✅ **Working Correctly:**
1. **Incoming Tickets** - Managers see tickets created by opposite team
2. **Outgoing Tickets** - Managers see tickets created by their team
3. **Assignment** - Managers can assign to team members
4. **Resolution** - Team members can resolve (process) assigned tickets

### ❌ **Potential Issues:**

1. **Processed Ticket Visibility**
   - When Growth processes an OPS ticket → OPS manager should see it for review
   - Currently: `getIncomingTickets` shows ALL tickets from opposite team (including processed)
   - This is **CORRECT** ✅
   - OPS manager can see processed tickets in Incoming Tickets list

2. **Acceptance Flow Missing?**
   - There's a `/reopen` endpoint for rejecting processed tickets
   - But is there an `/accept` endpoint to move from `processed` → `resolved`?
   - Looking at the code: The frontend has an "Accept" button that might be doing this

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - When ticket status changes, does the opposite manager's view update?
   - With 15-second refetch interval, yes ✅

## Verification Checklist

**When OPS Member Creates Ticket:**
- ✅ Appears in Growth Manager Incoming
- ✅ Growth Manager can assign to Growth member
- ✅ Growth member sees it in Assigned to Me
- ✅ Growth member can resolve (process) it
- ✅ After processing, appears back in... WHERE?
  - Should appear in OPS Manager's Incoming (for review)
  - `getIncomingTickets` shows tickets where `u.role = 'ops'` for Growth manager
  - This would STILL show the ticket even when processed ✅

**When Growth Member Creates Ticket:**
- ✅ Appears in OPS Manager Incoming
- ✅ OPS Manager can assign to OPS member
- ✅ OPS member sees it in Assigned to Me
- ✅ OPS member can resolve (process) it
- ✅ After processing, appears in Growth Manager's Incoming for review

## Complete Flow with Accept/Reopen

### When OPS Member Creates Ticket → Growth Processes

**Full Journey:**

1. **OPS Member creates** → Status: `open`, Assigned: `NULL`
   - Visible in: Growth Manager's "Incoming Tickets"

2. **Growth Manager assigns** to Growth Member
   - Status: `open`, Assigned: Growth Member ID
   - Visible in: Growth Member's "Assigned to Me"

3. **Growth Member resolves** (processes)
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/resolve`
   - Status: `processed`
   - Action: Uploads resolution files, adds resolution remarks
   - Visible in: 
     - Growth Manager's "Incoming Tickets" (status: processed)
     - OPS Member's "My Escalations" (their created ticket)

4. **OPS Member reviews** (has 2 options):

   **Option A: Accept & Close**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/close`
   - Status: `processed` → `closed`
   - Action: Can add acceptance remarks (optional)
   - Permission: ✅ Only creator's team (OPS) can close
   - UI: "Accept & Close" button in ticket detail page

   **Option B: Reopen**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/reopen`
   - Status: `processed` → `re-opened`
   - Action: Must provide reopen reason + optional files
   - Permission: ✅ Only creator's team (OPS) can reopen
   - UI: "Reopen" button in ticket detail page
   - Flow continues: Back to Growth team for updated resolution

### Permissions (All Correctly Implemented ✅)

**Frontend Logic (TicketDetailPage.tsx:426-438):**
```typescript
const canResolve = user?.role === 'admin' 
  ? (ticket.status === 'open' || ticket.status === 're-opened')
  : (ticket.creator_role === 'growth' && user?.role === 'ops' && (ticket.status === 'open' || ticket.status === 're-opened')) ||
    (ticket.creator_role === 'ops' && user?.role === 'growth' && (ticket.status === 'open' || ticket.status === 're-opened'));

const canReopen = user?.role === 'admin'
  ? ticket.status === 'processed'
  : user?.role === ticket.creator_role && ticket.status === 'processed';

const canClose = user?.role === 'admin'
  ? ticket.status === 'processed'
  : user?.role === ticket.creator_role && ticket.status === 'processed';
```

**Backend Enforcement:**
- ✅ `/resolve` - Opposite team only (lines 108-123)
- ✅ `/reopen` - Creator team only (lines 152-157)
- ✅ `/close` - Creator team only (lines 188-193)

## UI Components in Ticket Detail Page

When an **OPS member** views their **processed** ticket (that Growth resolved):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Reopen Ticket                              │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ Explain why this needs reopening... │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
│  Attach Supporting Files (Optional)         │
│  [File Upload Component]                    │
│                                             │
│  Acceptance Remarks (Optional)              │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ Add feedback about resolution...    │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐     │
│  │   Reopen    │  │ Accept & Close   │     │
│  └─────────────┘  └──────────────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
