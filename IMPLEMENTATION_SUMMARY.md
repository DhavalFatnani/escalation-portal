## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complete Ticket Workflow
```
Growth creates ticket (open)
         ↓
Ops adds resolution (processed)
         ↓
Growth reviews:
  ├─→ Accept (resolved)
  └─→ Reopen with reason (re-opened) → back to Ops
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Action | Growth | Ops | Admin |
|--------|--------|-----|-------|
| Create Ticket | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| View Own Tickets | ✓ | - | ✓ |
| View All Tickets | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Add Resolution | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reopen Ticket | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Close Ticket | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |

### 3. Ticket Numbering System
**Format:** `GROW-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`  
**Example:** `GROW-20251008-0001`

- Human-readable
- Chronologically sortable
- Daily sequential numbering
- Generated server-side (collision-safe)

### 4. Priority System
- **Urgent:** Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **High:** Important issues, same-day resolution
- **Medium:** Standard issues, 2-3 day target
- **Low:** Low-priority issues, flexible timeline

### 5. Search & Filters
- Full-text search (ticket number, brand, description)
- Filter by status, priority, date range
- Filter by creator or assignee
- Fast PostgreSQL tsvector search

### 6. Audit Trail
Every action logged to `ticket_activities`:
- Ticket created
- Status changed
- Resolution added
- Ticket reopened
- Ticket closed

### 7. Security Features
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Role-based middleware guards
- ✅ Input validation (Zod schemas)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS prevention
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ Security headers (Helmet)

```

### Test Workflow

1. **Login as Growth:**
   - Create a new ticket (urgent priority)
   - View it in the tickets list
   - See it on the dashboard

2. **Login as Ops:**
   - View all tickets
   - Open the ticket created by Growth
   - Add a resolution (status → processed)

3. **Login as Growth:**
   - View the processed ticket
   - Review the resolution
   - Either:
     - Accept and close (status → resolved)
     - Reopen with reason (status → re-opened)

4. **Check Activity Timeline:**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

The current implementation is a solid MVP. Here are ready-to-add features:

### Already Scaffolded (Easy to Add)
1. **File Attachments:** S3 integration code is ready, just needs configuration
2. **Email Notifications:** Service structure in place, add Postmark/SES keys
3. **Slack Notifications:** Webhook integration ready for urgent tickets

### Next Features to Build
1. **Metrics Dashboard:** SLA tracking, resolution times, re-open rates
2. **Bulk Operations:** Assign multiple tickets, export to CSV
3. **Templates:** Pre-defined ticket forms per issue type
4. **Advanced Search:** Elasticsearch integration for complex queries
5. **Mobile App:** React Native wrapper
6. **Webhooks:** Integrate with external systems

### Use Cursor to Build Them
Example prompts:
```
"Add a metrics dashboard showing tickets by status (pie chart), 
average resolution time by priority (bar chart), and SLA compliance rate"

"Implement S3 file upload with signed URLs for ticket attachments"

"Add email notifications using Postmark when tickets are resolved"
```

---

## 🛠️ Development with Cursor

This project is **optimized for Cursor AI development**:

### 1. `.cursorrules` File
Defines project conventions:
- Database naming (snake_case)
- Security requirements (parameterized queries, RBAC)
- Code style (TypeScript strict)
- Ticket lifecycle rules

### 2. Using Cursor Effectively

**Generate New Endpoint:**
```
"Add a GET /api/tickets/stats endpoint that returns counts by status and priority"
```

**Create React Component:**
```
"Create a TicketStatsCard component that shows ticket count, trend indicator, 
and links to filtered list"
```

**Database Changes:**
```
"Add a migration to support SLA deadlines: add sla_deadline and sla_breached columns"
```

**Write Tests:**
```
"Generate unit tests for ticketService.createTicket() covering edge cases"
```

### 3. Best Practices
- Commit small, focused changes
- Use Cursor's diff view to review AI suggestions
- Always ask for tests alongside feature code
- Leverage Cursor to explain complex code sections
