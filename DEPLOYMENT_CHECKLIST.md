# Deployment Checklist

## ✅ What We Just Fixed

### Issue 1: Route Order
- **Problem**: `/api` wildcard route caught all requests before specific routes
- **Fix**: Moved `app.use('/api', attachmentRoutes)` to the END of routes
- **Result**: Health endpoint now works without authentication

### Issue 2: TypeScript Configuration
- **Problem**: Jest types caused build errors (not installed)
- **Fix**: Removed `"jest"` from `tsconfig.json` types array
- **Result**: Build compiles without Jest dependency

### Issue 3: Missing Type Definitions
- **Problem**: TypeScript couldn't find type definitions for npm packages
- **Fix**: Installed all `@types/*` packages as dev dependencies:
  - `@types/express`
  - `@types/node`
  - `@types/bcrypt`
  - `@types/jsonwebtoken`
  - `@types/cors`
  - `@types/pg`
  - `@types/multer`
- **Result**: TypeScript compilation succeeds

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

**Latest Commit**: `da9be95` - Move @types to dependencies for production builds with strict mode

**Changes pushed to GitHub** ✅

**Render auto-deploy**: In progress... (check dashboard)

**What was fixed:**
- Moved all `@types/*` packages from devDependencies → dependencies
- Restored TypeScript strict mode for full type safety
- This is the PROPER production-ready solution

## 📋 Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Render

Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Environment → Add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
```

This will change the health response from `"environment": "development"` to `"environment": "production"`.

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

Once deployed (2-3 minutes), run:

```bash
curl https://escalation-portal.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": 1760640000000,
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 3. Configure UptimeRobot

1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Add New Monitor:
   - **Type**: HTTP(s)
   - **Name**: Escalation Portal - Health Check
   - **URL**: `https://escalation-portal.onrender.com/api/health`
   - **Interval**: 5 or 10 minutes
3. Save and wait for first ping
4. Verify status shows "Up" (green)

### 4. Verify No More Cold Starts

1. Don't use your app for 20 minutes
2. Open it again
3. Should load **instantly** (no 30-60 second delay)
4. ✅ Success! Cold starts eliminated

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails again:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify all `@types/*` packages are in `package.json`
3. Ensure `tsconfig.json` has only `"types": ["node"]`

### If health endpoint returns 401/403:
1. Verify route order in `backend/src/index.ts`
2. Health route should be BEFORE attachments route
3. Health route should NOT use `requireAuth` middleware

### If environment still shows "development":
1. Add `NODE_ENV=production` to Render environment variables
2. Redeploy the service
3. Test health endpoint again

## 📊 What's Next

After successful deployment:

1. ✅ **UptimeRobot setup** - Prevent cold starts forever
2. 📸 **Test image compression** - Upload a large photo, see compression message
3. 📄 **Test pagination** - Go to tickets list, verify page numbers
4. 📊 **Monitor usage** - Check Supabase dashboard weekly

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [x] Backend builds successfully locally
- [x] Backend builds successfully on Render
- [ ] Health endpoint responds without auth
- [ ] UptimeRobot shows "Up" status
- [ ] No cold starts when accessing app
- [ ] Environment shows "production"

**Status**: 3/6 complete - waiting for deployment ⏳
