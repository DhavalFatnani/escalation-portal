## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the migration SQL manually in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Create a new query
3. Copy the contents of `backend/migrations/012_add_manager_system.sql`
4. Run the query
5. Verify success (should see "Success. No rows returned")

**Migration SQL Location**: `/backend/migrations/012_add_manager_system.sql`

### Step 2: Seed Manager Users (Optional)

To add sample managers and team members, run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This will create:

**Managers:**
- `growth-manager@example.com` / `growth123`
- `ops-manager@example.com` / `ops123`

**Team Members:**
- `growth-member1@example.com` (Sarah Johnson) / `growth123`
- `growth-member2@example.com` (Mike Chen) / `growth123`
- `ops-member1@example.com` (John Smith) / `ops123`
- `ops-member2@example.com` (Lisa Wong) / `ops123`

**Legacy Users** (still work):
- `growth@example.com` / `growth123`
- `ops@example.com` / `ops123`
- `admin@example.com` / `admin123`

### Step 3: Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Test Locally

1. Start backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Start frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Login as a manager:
   - Email: `growth-manager@example.com`
   - Password: `growth123`

4. Test the manager features:
   - Visit Manager Dashboard
   - Create a ticket as a team member
   - Assign it from the manager dashboard
   - Manage team members (activate/deactivate)

### Step 5: Deploy to Render

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add manager workflow system"
git push
```

Render will automatically deploy the changes.

## 🎭 User Roles & Permissions

### Regular Team Member (growth/ops, is_manager=false)
- Create tickets
- View tickets assigned to them
- View team tickets
- Resolve assigned tickets

### Manager (growth/ops, is_manager=true)
- All team member permissions
- **Assign tickets** to teammates
- View unassigned tickets in Manager Dashboard
- **Manage team members** (activate/deactivate)
- View **team metrics** (resolution time, reopen rate, etc.)
- Add **manager notes** to tickets
- Toggle **auto-assign** for automatic ticket distribution

### Admin
- All manager permissions for both teams
- Create tickets for any team
- Override any status (Admin Controls)
- Manage all users (mark active/inactive)
- System-wide metrics
- Delete tickets

## 🔄 Ticket Workflow

### Growth Team Creates Ticket:
1. Growth Member creates ticket → **Status: open**, **Assigned: null**
2. Growth Manager sees it in "Pending Assignments"
3. Growth Manager assigns to Growth teammate (or self)
4. Ticket visible to Ops Manager
5. Ops Manager assigns to Ops teammate
6. Ops teammate resolves → **Status: processed**
7. Back to Growth Manager/team for review
8. Growth accepts → **Status: resolved** OR reopens

### Ops Team Creates Ticket:
1. Ops Member creates ticket → **Status: open**, **Assigned: null**
2. Ops Manager sees it in "Pending Assignments"
3. Ops Manager assigns to Ops teammate (or self)
4. Ticket visible to Growth Manager
5. Growth Manager assigns to Growth teammate
6. Growth teammate resolves → **Status: processed**
7. Back to Ops Manager/team for review
8. Ops accepts → **Status: resolved** OR reopens

## 📊 Manager Dashboard Features

### Pending Assignments
- Shows all unassigned tickets
- Sortedby priority (Urgent → High → Medium → Low)
- One-click assignment
- Visual priority indicators

### Team Workload
- Bar chart showing tickets per team member
- Color-coded (green/yellow/red) based on load
- Auto-assign toggle
- Shows inactive team members

### Team Metrics
- Open Tickets count
- Processed Tickets count
- Average Resolution Time (hours)
- Reopen Rate (percentage)
- Refreshes automatically every 60 seconds

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### Manager Routes (`/api/managers/*`)
- `GET /api/managers/team` - Get team members
- `GET /api/managers/tickets/pending` - Unassigned tickets
- `GET /api/managers/metrics` - Team performance
- `PATCH /api/managers/users/:user_id/toggle-active` - Activate/deactivate
- `PATCH /api/managers/auto-assign` - Toggle auto-assign

### Ticket Assignment
- `POST /api/tickets/:ticket_number/assign` - Assign ticket

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Existing Tickets**: All existing tickets will have `assigned_to = NULL` (unassigned). Managers should assign them.

2. **Existing Users**: All existing users will have:
   - `is_manager = FALSE` (regular members)
   - `is_active = TRUE` (all active)
   
   You can manually update users to managers in Supabase:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET is_manager = TRUE WHERE email = 'your-manager@example.com';
   ```

3. **Inactive Users**: Cannot log in. Show error: "Account is inactive. Please contact your manager."

4. **Auto-Assign**: Uses round-robin (assigns to member with lowest workload). Only for managers when enabled.

## 🎨 UI Highlights

- **Purple theme** for manager features
- **Orange badges** for unassigned tickets
- **Green badges** for assigned tickets
- **Real-time updates** with React Query
- **Responsive design** for mobile/tablet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- **Solution**: Run the SQL manually in Supabase SQL Editor (see Step 1)

### Users Can't Log In
- **Check**: User `is_active` status in database
- **Fix**: `UPDATE users SET is_active = TRUE WHERE email = 'user@example.com';`

### Manager Dashboard Empty
- **Check**: User has `is_manager = TRUE`
- **Check**: There are unassigned tickets

### Assignment Not Working
- **Check**: Assignee is active (`is_active = TRUE`)
- **Check**: Manager has permission (same team or admin)

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Growth member creates ticket → Growth manager sees it
- [ ] Growth manager assigns to teammate → Teammate sees it
- [ ] Ops manager sees escalation → Can assign to Ops team
- [ ] Inactive user cannot login
- [ ] Manager can toggle teammate active/inactive
- [ ] Admin can manage all teams
- [ ] Metrics calculate correctly
- [ ] Assignment history logged in activities
- [ ] Auto-assign distributes tickets evenly

## 🎉 Success!

Your manager workflow system is ready to use! Login as a manager to start assigning tickets and managing your team.
